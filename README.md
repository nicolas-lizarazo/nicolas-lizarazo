# Hey there! 👋

I'm Nicolás, a developer focused on building clean, scalable, and modular web applications. 

I enjoy transforming complex logic into organized code, always following best practices like **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID principles**.

### 🛠️ My Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3.
- **Backend:** Node.js (currently diving deep into expert level).
- **Architecture:** MVC Pattern, Modular Design, Clean Code.
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code, Figma.

### 📚 Currently Learning
- Advanced Node.js patterns with Fernando Herrera.
- Scalable backend architectures and professional documentation.
- Improving my skills in TypeScript and API design.

### 📁 Featured Project: Advanced To-Do List
I'm currently building a To-Do List that is much more than a simple list. It’s a practice ground for:
- **Modular Architecture (MVC):** Decoupling UI from business logic.
- **Persistence:** Real-time synchronization with LocalStorage.
- **ES Modules:** Leveraging modern JS standards for better maintainability.

### Fun Facts:
- ☕ Fuelled by curiosity (and maybe some coffee).
- 🏗️ I love breaking things just to learn how to put them back together.
- 🎮 In my free time, I enjoy practice sports and play videogames.
